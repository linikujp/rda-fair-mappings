Mapping LGBTQ+-related thesauri into an accompanying ontology.

### Domain

LGBTQ+ studies

### Purpose of the mapping

Semantic interoperability

### Other purpose of the mapping

This mapping will produce a new ontology, but it should be usable both as an ontology and as a thesaurus

### Type of mapped resources

Most resources included are ontologies (FMA, MONDO, DO, GSSO), classification schemes (ICD, DSM), thesauri (Homosaurus) , or subject heading schemes (LCSH, MeSH). However, this resource is built in Wikibase (https://lgbtdb.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page) and therefore also includes thousands of resources that are cited for each relationship. More information can be found [here](https://lgbtdb.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Project:Mappings).

### Links to an existing mappings

We are currently using hundreds of mapping documents, including:

- LCSH/MeSH Mapping Project (https://github.com/galterlibrary/mapping-project)
- LCSH mappings to ISNI, VIAF, Wikidata, etc.
- Homosaurus mappings to LCSH and to previous and future versions of the Homosaurus
- Wikidata mappings occasionally
- ICD-10/11 mappings (from WHO)
- ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM mappings (from U.S. government)
- DC Mappings to Schema.org
- SNOMED International Mapping Tool (for mappings from SNOMED to ICD-10)
- Research Metadata Schema Crosswalk Mappings to Schema.org
- Dublin Core to PROV Mapping
- DC type mapping to CIDOC/CRM
- DCAT-AP to Schema.org Mapping
- SUMO-OWL to YAGO (https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo/)
- SUMO-OWL to DBpedia (https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo/)
- DBpedia to Wikidata
- A unidirectional mapping of ICD-8 to ICD-10 codes, for harmonized longitudinal analysis of diseases
- DataCite to DCAT-AP Mapping
- Mapping the Provenance Ontology to Basic Formal Ontology (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.03866)

Among a number of others.

### Tools used for creating the mapping

Manual mapping.

### Type of mapping relations

Entity mappings, usually one-to-one but occasionally one-to-many.

### Examples (samples) of different types of mapping implementations

Mapping is performed manually based on pre-existing published mappings. If some mappings do not function (i.e. they are not logically or semantically interoperable) they are still added and cited, but deprecated.
